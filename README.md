THIS IS LEARNING PROJECT OF NODE WHERE I AM CREATING A BACKEND USING NODEJS, POSTGRES WHERE USER CAN HAVE A TOUR - A MODIFIED TOUR
USER CAN CREATE A TOUR OF ANY LOCATION
THIS CITY/COUNTRY CAN CONTAINS MANY PLACES AND ACTIVITIES BUT USER HAVE LIMITED TIME AND WANT TO VISIT PARTICULAR PLACES AND WANT TO PERFORM SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES ON HIS/HER TOUR
HE/SHE CAN CREATE A MODIFIED TOUR WHERE HE/SHE CAN ADD PLACES/ACTIVITIES THAT HE/SHE WANT TO PERFORM IN HIS/HER TIME ON THIS TOUR
FINAL PRICE AFTER DISCOUNT WILL BE FINALIZE ONCE HE/SHE SELECTES ALL HIS/HER FAVOURITE PLACES AND ACTIVITIES
SPECIFIC PLACES AND ACITIVITIES REQUIRE MORE MAN POWER THAT HAVE TO HANDLE FOR THIS SPECIFIC USER THAT'S FINAL PRICE WILL BE DIFFERENT FOR CUSTOMIZE TOUR THAN ORIGINAL TOUR -> PLACES/ACTIVITIES
